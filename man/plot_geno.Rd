\title{Make those awesome plots that Felipe showed me, but using ggplot2.}
\usage{
plot_geno(ocounts, osize, ploidy, p1counts = NULL, p1size = NULL,
  p2counts = NULL, p2size = NULL, col = NULL, seq_error = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{ocounts}{A vector of non-negative integers. The number of reference alleles observed in the offspring.}

\item{osize}{A vector of positive integers. The total number of reads in the offspring.}

\item{ploidy}{A non-negative integer. The ploidy of the species.}

\item{p1counts}{A vector of non-negative integers. The number of reference alleles observed in parent 1.}

\item{p1size}{A vector of positive integers. The total number of reads in parent 1.}

\item{p2counts}{A vector of non-negative integers. The number of reference alleles observed in parent 2.}

\item{p2size}{A vector of positive integers. The total number of reads in parent 2.}

\item{col}{The color labels.}

\item{seq_error}{The average sequencing error rate.}
