\title{This function just updates everything. No options allowed!}
\usage{
updog_update_all(ocounts, osize, ploidy, seq_error)
}
\arguments{
\item{ocounts}{A vector of non-negative integers. The ith element
is the number of reads of the reference allele the ith child.}

\item{osize}{A vector of positive integers. The ith element is the
total number of reads for the ith child.}

\item{ploidy}{A positive integer. The number of copies of the
genome in the species.}

\item{seq_error}{A non-negative numeric. This is the known
sequencing error rate. The default is to estimate this
using data that are all approximately the reference allele.}
}
\description{
This is the same as assuming a uniform prior on the parental genotypes,
then estimating these genotypes by maximum marginal likelihood.
Though this implementation does not allow for an outlier model.

\details{
I mostly created this to check my gradient and objective function
implementations.
