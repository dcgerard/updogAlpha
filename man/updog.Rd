\usage{
updog(ocounts, osize, ploidy, p1counts = NULL, p1size = NULL,
  p2counts = NULL, p2size = NULL, seq_error = 0.1, do_mcmc = FALSE,
  burnin = 250, itermax = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{ocounts}{A vector of non-negative integers. The ith element is the
number of reads of the reference allele the ith child.}

\item{osize}{A vector of positive integers. The ith element is the total
number of reads for the ith child.}

\item{ploidy}{A positive integer. The number of copies of the genome in the
species.}

\item{p1counts}{A vector of non-negative integers. The ith element is the
number of reads of the reference allele in the ith sample of parent 1.
If \code{NULL} then the prior probabilities on parent 1's genotype will default
to uniform.}

\item{p1size}{A vector of positive integers. The ith element is the total
number of reads in the ith sample of parent 1.
If \code{NULL} then the prior probabilities on parent 1's genotype will default
to uniform.}

\item{p2counts}{A vector of non-negative integers. The ith element is the
number of reads of the reference allele in the ith sample of parent 2.
If \code{NULL} then the prior probabilities on parent 2's genotype will default
to uniform.}

\item{p2size}{A vector of positive integers. The ith element is the total
number of reads in the ith sample of parent 2.
If \code{NULL} then the prior probabilities on parent 2's genotype will default
to uniform.}

\item{seq_error}{A non-negative numeric. This is the known sequencing error
rate. This is a rough high-ball error rate given by Li et. al. (2011).}

\item{do_mcmc}{A logical. Should we also run a Gibbs sampler to jointly estimate
the parental and child genotypes (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE})? If \code{TRUE},
the total number of iterations run is \code{burnin + iteramx}.}

\item{burnin}{A non-negative integer. The number of iterations to ignore
in the Gibbs sampler if \code{do_mcmc = TRUE}.}

\item{itermax}{A positive integer. The number of iterations to collect
in the Gibbs sampler if \code{do_mcmc = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list with some or all of the following elements:
  \code{opostprob}: A matrix of proportions whose (i, j)th element
  is the posterior probability that child j has i - 1 copies of the reference allele.
  That is, the rows index the genotype and the columns index the offspring.
  These are derived by the one-offspring-at-a-time procedure.

  \code{p1postprob}: A vector of proportions whose ith element is the posterior
  probability that parent 1 has i - 1 copies of the reference allele.
  These are derived ONLY from parent 1's sequence data and not jointly with
  all of the data.

  \code{p2postprob}: A vector of proportions whose ith element is the posterior
  probability that parent 2 has i - 1 copies of the reference allele.
  These are derived ONLY from parent 2's sequence data and not jointly with
  all of the data.

  \code{m_opostprob}: A matrix of proportions whose (i, j)th element
  is the posterior probability that child j has i - 1 copies of the reference allele.
  These are derived from the joint analysis with MCMC.

  \code{m_p1postprob}: A vector of proportions whose ith element is the posterior
  probability that parent 1 has i - 1 copies of the reference allele.
  These are derived from the joint analysis with MCMC.

  \code{m_p2postprob}: A vector of proportions whose ith element is the posterior
  probability that parent 2 has i - 1 copies of the reference allele.
  These are derived from the joint analysis with MCMC.

\description{
This function fits a hierarchical model to sequence counts from a collection
of siblings and return genotyped information. The hierarchy comes from the fact
that they share the same parents. If you also have parental sequencing data,
then you can include this to improve estimates.
}
\details{
If you have a lot of parental sequencing data, then it could suffice to run
\code{updog} with \code{do_mcmc} set to \code{FALSE}. Otherwise, you will
probably want to borrow strength between the offspring by setting \code{do_mcmc}
to \code{TRUE}.
